* **About page**, a short text that sum up who i am, where i am studying now and my center of interest. 
* **Work Page**, this part contains some of my most important project and the work i am on currently.



## How It Works

The OCR contains a CLI tool which is used to demonstrate the **segmentation** part of the project.

### Usage

```bash
make
./src/main
```

The trash files produced by the compilation could be removed by :

```bash
make clean
```

or

```bash
make properclean
```

## Interface

The interface is made with SDL 2.0, it's a really simple component that need to be refactored. Here is a diagram that demonstrate its usability.
